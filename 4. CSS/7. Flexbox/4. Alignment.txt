We know the flex: 1; rule makes items grow or shrink to fill available space. This isn't always the desired effect. 

Justify-content:

- Distributes flex items inside the container based on value provided
- Aligns items across the main axis
- Rule is applied to the flex container

div {
    Justify-content: space-between;
}

Align-items: 

- Distributes flex items along the cross axis
- Rule is applied to flex container

NOTE: 
- justify-content and align-items are based on the main and cross axis of the flex container thus their behavior changes when we change the flex-direction
- Can result in unexpected results if not careful

Gap: 

- Adds a space between flex items, similar to adding margin to items
- Rule is applied to flex container
- Very new but browser supported


Knowledge Check:

What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?
- justify-content distributes flex items along the main axis, align-items distributes flex items along the cross axis. These swap when we change the flex-direction of a flex container.

How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?
- set justify-content to center, set align-items to center

Whatâ€™s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?
- space-between creates even space between the flex items with no care for space on the outermost flex items. space-around creates even space between and around the flex items.
