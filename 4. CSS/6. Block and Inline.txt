Block vs Inline: 

- Most elements are block elements
    - display: block; by default
    - Appear on page stacked on top of each other, each element starting on a new line
- Inline elements do not start on a new line, they appear in line with whatever they are placed beside
    - e.g a <a> element will always display inline when nested inside a <p>
    - padding and margin behave differently on inline elements
- So what is Inline-Block?
    - Elements with display: inline-block; behave like inline elements, with block style padding and margin. 
    - Rare use case these days due to flexbox

Div and Spans:

- Unlike most elements, div and spans give no particular meaning to their content
    - Just generic boxes that can contain anything
- Use cases: 
    - Grouping related elements under one parent element to correctly position the group on the page

Div:

- Block level element by default
- Commonly used as a container element to group other child elements
- Make it easy to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks

Spans:

- Inline element by default
- Groups text content and inline HTML elements for styling
    - Should only be used when no other semantic HTML is appropriate
