External CSS:

- Create separate CSS file and link it using a <link> element inside the <head> tag in the HTML

<head>
    ....
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    ....
</head>

- href can be absolute or relative
- Keeps HTML and CSS separate, keeping HTML looking cleaner
- Only need to edit the CSS in one place


Internal CSS:

- Also known as embedded CSS
- Place all rules inside of <style> tags, which are in the <head> tag in the HTML

<head>
    <style>
        div {
            color: white;
            background-color: black;
        }

        p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

- Useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website
- If lots of styles, it can make the HTML file big for no reason


Inline CSS:

- Add styles directly to an HTML element
- Rarely recommended

<body>
    <div style="color: white; background-color: black;">...</div>
</body>

- Note: no selectors are used here, as we are applying styles to this specific element
- This will override all previous CSS which can cause unexpected results
