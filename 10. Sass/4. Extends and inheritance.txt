Sass @extend directive: 

- Lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another 
- Useful if you have almost identically styled elements that have only small differences 

e.g we create a style for buttons, then we create one particular style for the report button and one for the submit button 

.button-basic  {
  border: none;
  padding: 15px 30px;
}

.button-report  {
  @extend .button-basic;
  background-color: red;
}

.button-submit  {
  @extend .button-basic;
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}

- Also means we don't have to specify multiple classes on an element in HTML, we can just class="button-report" and get the default button styles as well
- Keeps code DRY
