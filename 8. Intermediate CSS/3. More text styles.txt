Fonts: 

- If we use the font-family property to change to a font and these fonts are not installed on the user's computer, then a fallback is used
    - If no fallback has been defined, then the default HTML font will be used

Online fonts: 

- We can get fonts from online font libraries like Google Fonts, Font Library or Adobe Fonts 
    - We go to their website, select a font and then copy a snippet to load the font from their server onto our website
    - Alternatively, we'll use an @import tag that can be dropped at the top of a CSS file
    - It is especially important to add a fallback font if we are loading fonts over an external API

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

or:

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap');

Downloaded fonts: 

- We can also download the font from the web, load it into our project and define it at the top of our CSS file with the @font-face rule
- There are multiple types of font file formats e.g .woff, .ttf
- More reliable that loading fonts over a third-party API

@font-face {
  font-family: my-cool-font;
  src: url(../fonts/the-font-file.woff);
}

Text Styles: 

font-style:

- Generally used for making font italic, when we don't need to use the <em> tag (significant/emphasized text)

letter-spacing: 

- Changes the space between letters in a word
- Useful for adjusting custom fonts 

line-height: 

- Changes the space between lines in wrapped text

text-transform: 

- Changes the case of the given text

text-shadow:

- Adds a shadow around the text in the selected element
- Best used sparingly but can used to great effect
