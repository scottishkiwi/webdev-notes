Background: 

- background is actually a shorthand property for 8 different background related properties
    - Background color, background images, position and size of the images, how the images repeat if they are too small
- We can also set these properties individually which might be easier and more clear than trying to use the shorthand 
    - This is in comparison to some properties where it is almost always better to use shorthand (flex, margin, padding etc.)

Borders: 

- border is another shorthand that defines a border's size, style and color
- border-radius creates rounded corners on things

Box-shadow:

- box-shadow adds a shadow effect around an element
- Creates a sense of depth on the page and provides subtle separation 
    - Best when used sparingly

Overflow: 

- overflow defines what happens when an element's content is too big to fit
- Common usage is to add scrollbars 

Opacity: 

- opacity defines the opacity of an element
