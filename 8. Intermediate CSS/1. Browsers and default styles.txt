Browser History: 

- The WorldWideWeb browser was released in 1990, later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion with the World Wide Web
- Allowed users to view basic style sheets, read newsgroups
- Over the next decade, Mosaic Browser was released and quickly gained popularity
- Then the growth of the World Wide Web really exploded with the release of Opera and Netscape Navigator 
- IE was released in 1995 and became the dominant player
    - At one point, IE was used by 90% of all users 
    - Netscape launched the Mozilla foundation, which develops and maintains Firefox
- In 2003, Apple launches Safari and in 2008 Google launches Chrome

Browser Compatibility: 

- Different browsers use different engines to display information on the web page
    - Chrome and Chromium utilize Blink (Chromium is OpenSource version of chrome that is also the base of Microsoft Edge and Brave browsers)
    - Safari uses Webkit
- These different engines can result in different behaviors between browsers 
    - These days, most applications are designed to work smoothly in Chrome and providing as good of a performance in other browsers is secondary

Browser Releases and New CSS Features: 

- W3C is the authority behind developing web standards to maximize accessibility and consistency amongst the web experience 
    - Also the authority to develop new features in CSS 
- As the standards around the web evolve and change, browsers must provide support for these new features
    - If the UX is impacted by the lack of support in the browsers then users may start using a different browser

When is it Safe to use new features?

- "Can I use" is a resource to help validate if new features are supported by the browsers
    - Provides statistics on which browsers and platforms are supporting new technologies, and which specific version it supports 
- Generally its good practice to wait until new features are support the most common browsers 

Mobile Browsers:

- Traditionally the web was desktop computer first 
- As smartphones have been more popular, more and more users are using mobile devices as their main device for interacting with the web
- The most populate mobile OS are Android and Apple's IOS 
- We must consider mobile design when developing applications 
    - On iOS, Safari is technically the only supported browser (even though you can install Chrome or Firefox) 
        - For web applications to work for Apple users, we have to ensure our app works with WebKit 
    - Lots of different screen sizes, too many to test.
        - Can use the DevTools to emulate devices and different screen sizes 

Default Styles: 

- Some elements already have style applied to them from the default styles that come with a browser
- No guarantee that the browsers will act in the same way and inconsistencies do exist
- In many cases we will overwriting most of this default styling to make our site look how we envision inconsistencies
- Many developers will have a default CSS reset file that undoes browser defaults, or maybe even styles certain elements in a consistent way across all browsers 
    - e.g Normalize.css
