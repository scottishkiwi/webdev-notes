Default Styles: 

- Some elements already have style applied to them from the default styles that come with a browser
- No guarantee that the browsers will act in the same way and inconsistencies do exist
- In many cases we will overwriting most of this default styling to make our site look how we envision inconsistencies
- Many developers will have a default CSS reset file that undoes browser defaults, or maybe even styles certain elements in a consistent way across all browsers 
    - e.g Normalize.css
