Working with Text:

Paragraphs: <p></p> 

- Adds newline after each of our Paragraphs

Headings:

- Six different levels of headings <h1> -> <h6> 
- Ranked by importance and size 
- Provides hierachy to the content
- An <h1> should always be used for heading of the overall page

Strong element:

- <strong> makes text bold and marks it as important (affects tools like screen readers)
- Usually used inside other tags

Em element:

- <em> makes text italic and places emphasis on the word (affects tools like screen readers)
- Usually used inside other tags

Nesting and indentation: 

- Elements are nested within other elements creating parent and child relationships between them
- Becomes important when we start working with CSS and Javascript

HTML comments: 

- Not visible to browser
- Allow us to comment on our code using the following syntax <!-- dasdasdas -->
