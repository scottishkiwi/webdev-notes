The anatomy of an Error:

- Type of object built into JS
    - Consists of a name/type and a message
    - Also gives us the name of the file in which the error can be found and the line number 
- Clicking on an error can provide the stack trace
    - Lets us trace the evolution of the error back to its origin call


Common types of errors:

Syntax Error: 

- Code is not written correctly, according to the grammatical rules of JS

Reference Error:

- Thrown when one refers to a variable that is not declared or initialized within the current scope
- Error name/type is: "Uncaught ReferenceError", the message varies based on the Error

Type Error:

- Generally related to an issue with the data type you are trying to run an operation against
    - An argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that function
    - Attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed
    - Attempting to us a value in an incorrect way 


Tips for resolving errors:

1) Read carefully and understand

2) Google the error
    - Likely a fix/explanation on StackOverflow or in the JS/library docs

3) Use the DevTools debugger
    - Set a breakpoint to view the value of a given variable at any point and then step through the code line by line

4) Use console.log() for quick debugging to get immediate feedback without needing to step through your functions


Errors vs Warnings:

- Errors stop the execution of a program 
- Warnings are messages that provide insight on potential problems that may not necessarily crash the program 
    - Typically shown in yellow


Knowledge Check: 

What are three reasons why you may see a TypeError?
- Trying to use a data type in a way that it is not meant to be used e.g calling .push on a String 

What is the key difference between an error and a warning?
- Errors will stop the program from executing at all, warnings are just messages that provide insight on possible problems but will not cause the program to stop working

What is one method you can use to resolve an error?
- Debugging, Googling
