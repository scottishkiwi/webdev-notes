Relatively new way of positioning elements but has become default way of position elements for many developers

Let's Flex:

- Arrange elements into rows or columns
    - Elements will flex (grow or shrink) based on flex rules we can define
- Not just a single property but a whole toolbox of properties
    - Some of these properties belong to the flex container and some apply to the flex item

Flex container:

- Any element that has display: flex; on it

Flex item: 

- Any element inside a flex container
- Has flex:1; on it

Note: 

- An element can be a flex item and a flex container
    - You can put display: flex; on a flex item, to make it become a flex container and use it to arrange its children
    - Nesting multiple flex containers and items is the secret sauce to building complex layouts
