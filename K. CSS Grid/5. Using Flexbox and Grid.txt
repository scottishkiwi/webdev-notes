Content First vs Layout First Design: 

- The different use of Grid and Flexbox depends on whether the design originates with the contents, or from the overall layout
    - If starting with the content (Content-first design) = Flexbox, easy to manipulate code in one dimensions, along either rows or columns
    - If starting with the layout (layout-first design) and need explicit placement of elements in two dimensions = Grid. 
    
Combining Flexbox and Grid: 

- If you have one-dimensional content, Flexbox can make it easier to control how that content is position in a Flex container 
- If we want to accurately place content on a complete layout in two dimensions, Grid can be simpler to use 

- We can also have the overall layout be a grid, but the grid items act as flex parents 
    - The grid items can be moved around using the precist two dimensional placements of Grid
    - The content inside the grid items can be easily moved around using Flex.
