A look back at Flex: 

- We position items along two axes (main and cross)
- We set their alignment using either justify-content (main) or align-items (cross)
- We set whether we want the flex items to grow, shrink or change their size

- For one dimensional layouts, Flex offers a convenient tool without having to rely on floats or painful CSS hacks to align the items properly 
- For two dimensional layouts, we found that flex-wrap allowed us to wrap our flex items onto the next line
    - This isn't always easy and is hard to scale up
    - Introducing CSS Grid

CSS Grid: 

- Inspired by use of grid-like layouts in other forms of media (newspapers, magazines)
- Often praised for easy placements of items in a two dimensional layout 
    - But can be used for one dimensional layouts as well

Similarities between Flex and Grid: 

- Both use parent containers with child items
- Similar property names for alignment and positioning
