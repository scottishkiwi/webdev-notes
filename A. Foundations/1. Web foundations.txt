What is a network? 

- Connection between machines so they can communicate. Either done physically (ethernet) or wirelessly (wifi, bluetooth). 

What is a router? 

- Larger networks become complicated. E.g ten machines would need 45 cables with nine plugs per machine. 
    - Introduce Router: ensures that communication to a given computer arrives at correct destination
    - Now ten machines only require 10 cables, a single plug for each machine and a router with 10 plugs

What is the internet?

- How about next scale up from 10 machines? 
    - Can't use a single router for thousands of machines, so we connect routers to routers. (routers just another machine)
    - This idea is the basis of the internet
- What about connecting to other peoples network, we can't just set cables up between every house (or can we?)
    - These wires already exist for telephone infra, but to connect our network to the telephone infra we need a modem. 
    
What is an ISP?

- Sending a message from our network, to another network?
    - We connect our network to an ISP. 
- An ISP manages special routers that are all linked together and can access other ISP routers. Our message is carried through the network of ISP networks, to the destination. 

What is an IP?

- If we want to communicate with another computer, we have to specify which one. Any computer linked to a network has a unique address - an IP address (internet protocol). 
- How to read IPs as humans?
    - We alias an IP address with a human readable name - domain name. 

What are clients and servers?

- Clients -> web user's internet-connected device
- Servers -> computers that store webpages, sites, apps

What else is involved?

- Internet connection -> allow you to send and receive data on the web
- TCP/IP -> Transmission Control Protocol, Internet Protocol. Define how data should travel across the internet. 
- DNS (Domain Name System) -> Address book for websites. Maps a web address in your browser to the websites IP address. 
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) -> Application protocol that allows clients and servers to communicate. 
- Component Files -> A website's files. Code files and website assets. 

So what happens when I type in a domain name into my web browser?

1. Browser goes to the DNS server and finds the IP address of the server that the website lives on
2. Browser sends an HTTP request to the server asking for a copy of the website to the client. 
    - This message and all data is sent between client and server using TCP/IP. 
3. If server approves the request, it returns a 200 message (happy response) and then starts sending website files to the browser in a series of small chunks called data packers. 
4. Browser assembles the chunks into a complete web page and displays it.

What is a packet?

- When data is sent across the web, it is sent in thousands of small chunks. Why? 
    - Incase packets are dropped or corrupted, it is easier to replace small chunks when this happens
    - Packets can be router along different paths, making the exchange faster
    - If each website was sent in one big chunk, only one end user could download it at a time
