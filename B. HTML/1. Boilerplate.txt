Basic Boilerplate for an HTML document

Naming conventions:

- Name it <blah>.html 
- Usually the home page in a website is index.html. Web servers will by default look for an index.html when users visit a website. Can change this behavior in web server config.

DOCTYPE: 

- Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration to inform the browser of what version of HTML it should use to render a document
- The latest version of HTML is HTML5 and the doctype is simply: <!DOCTYPE html>

<html> element: 

- Root element of a document is the <html> element, every other element in the document will be a descendant of it. 
- lang attribute in the html tag specifies the language of the text content inside the element. 

<head> element: 

- Meta-information about our webpages, e.g data for SEO, data for accessibility, title (displayed in browser tab)
- Charset meta element
    - Specifies the charset encoding of the webpages : <meta charset="utf-8">
    - Ensures the webpage will display special symbols and characters correctly

<body> element:

- All the content that will be displayed
