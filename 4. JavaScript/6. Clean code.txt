Rules of Thumb: 

1) Indentation:
- There are various options and some recommended one over another but what is important is consistency, using the same indentation. 

2) Semicolons:
- These are mostly optional because the JS compiler will automatically insert them if they are omitted.

3) Line length: 
- Limit the length of each line of code. Not quite as strict of a rule but code will be easier to read if the lines are broken and not longer than 80 characters. 
- When manually breaking a line, you should indent the second line 2 levels e.g 

let reallyReallyLongLine = something + somethingElse + anotherThing +
		howManyTacos + oneMoreReallyLongThing;

4) Naming things: 
- Names should be descriptive and use camelCase
- Variables should always begin with a noun/adjective and functions with a verb 
- It is okay to use single characters as variable names in the context of a loop or callback function, but not elsewhere

Knowledge Check: 

Why is it important to write clean code?
- Mainly for readability to make the overall build more efficient

Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
- Correct indentation, write explanatory comments, avoid large functions, avoid abusing comments, use naming standards. 

What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
- Keen it concise and only comment in terms of variables and results except for authoring specifications.
