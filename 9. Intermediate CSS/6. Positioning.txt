Static and Relative Positioning: 

- position: static;
    - The default position of every element
    - The properties top, right, bottom and left do not affect the position of static elements
- position: relative; 
    - Pretty much the same as static but properties top, right, bottom and left displace the element relative to its normal position

Absolute Positioning: 

- position: absolute;
    - Allows us to position something at an exact point on the screen without affecting other elements 
    - The element will be removed from the normal document flow
    - Elements are positioned anywhere on the screen using top, right, bottom and left
    - Useful when we need to position something at an exact point e.g modals, icons 

Fixed Positioning:

- position: fixed; 
    - Elements are also removed from the normal flow of document and are position relative to the viewport 
    - Use top, right, bottom and left to position it and the element will stay there, even as the user scrolls 
    - Used for things like nav bars and floating chat buttons 

Sticky Positioning: 

- position: sticky; 
    - Elements act like normal elements until we scroll past them and then they behave like fixed elements 
    - Used for section headings and sticky banners

Knowledge Check: 

What is the difference between static and relative positioning?
- Static is the default position of every element and the top, left, bottom and right properties don't work
- Relative is pretty much the same but we can change the position relative to the elements normal position using the top, left, bottom and right properties 

What is absolute positioning useful for?
- Allows us to position something exactly on the screen, useful for modals

What is the difference between fixed and sticky positioning?
- Fixed elements are positioned relative to the viewport and never leave the screen
- Sticky elements are normal elements until they are scrolled to, and then they become fixed
