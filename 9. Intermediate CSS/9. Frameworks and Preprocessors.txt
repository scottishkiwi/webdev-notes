Frameworks: 

- Bootstrap and Tailwind do the heavy lifting of packaging up commonly used CSS code
- Ultimately just a bundle of CSS that can be used and access using the classes defined by the framework
    - e.g many frameworks will provide a class called .btn that will add button styles without us having to write any CSS 
- In general, to use a framework we just need to know how it expects us to lay out a site, and which classes to use to apply the styles 

Disadvantages of Frameworks: 

- Results in many similar looking websites due to similar use of frameworks
- Can also allow developers to skip learning CSS properly 
    - Overriding a frameworks styling or debugging style issues can become hard
    - It is important to know whats going on under the hood
- Tricky to remove a CSS framework from a project once its in place without a large amount of work 

Preprocessors: 

- Languages that help us write CSS more easily 
- Reduce code repetition, provide all sorts of time-saving and code-saving features 
    - Some preprocessors allow us to write loops, join multiple stylesheets and nest CSS selectors 
- When we run the processor, it takes the code with extra functionality (nesting, mixins and variables) and outputs vanilla CSS that we can use in the browser
- Classic preprocessors are SASS and LESS
