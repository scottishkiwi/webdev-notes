Tables: 

- Some data just really needs to be in a table 
- HTML tables are a less common element when compared with buttons, links, lists but they are the perfect tool in some cases 

- The point of a table is to be rigid 
- Information should be easily interpreted by making visual association between row and column headers
- When implemented correctly, tables are handled well by accessibility tools such as screen readers

When should we NOT use HTML tables?

- Should only be used for tabular data 
- Should never be used to layout a webpage instead of CSS techniques: 
    - Reduces accessibility
    - Tables produce tag soup (complex markup structure)
    - Not responsive without CSS 

Table elements: 

- Every table is enclosed by the table tag <table></table>
- The smallest container inside a table is a table cell <td></td> (table data)
    - If we wanted a row of four cells: 

<td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
<td>I'm your second cell.</td>
<td>I'm your third cell.</td>
<td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>

- To specify that these 4 cells are part of one row, we use <tr></tr> (table row)

<tr>
    <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
</tr>

- To recognize a table header as proper headers we need to use <th></th> (table header)
- Sits inside a <tr> but specifically denotes a row header rather than a normal cell

Allowing cells to span multiple rows/columns: 

- <th> and <td> can use the colspan or rowspan attribute 
    - Both accept a number value which equals the number of rows or columns we want the cell/header to span

Styling columns made easier: 

- It can be annoying to specify styling on columns (need to end up using :nth-child selectors)
- Can use a <col> element to specify inline styles once
    - <col> elements sit inside <colgroup> element which sits just below the opening <table> tag

<table>
    <colgroup>
        <col>
        <col style="background-color: yellow">
    </colgroup>
    <tr>
        <th>Data 1</th>
        <th>Data 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Calcutta</td>
        <td>Orange</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Robots</td>
        <td>Jazz</td>
    </tr>
</table>

- The above creates styling for two different columns, the first is un-styled and the second has a yellow background
- Can also use the span attribute to make the <col> style span more than one column: 

<colgroup>
    <col style="background-color: yellow" span="2">
</colgroup>
